# Persistent Handlers/Object Identifiers

*Handlers*, *Persistent Identifiers* (PID) or *Document Object Identifiers* (DOI) provide a convenient way for referring to your work, your Simulation Package.

There are several ways of how to obtain such an ID. The easiest one might be the [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org){: target=_blank} service which has been already mentioned in ["How to refer to Input Data"](inputdata.md). 

Please login to zenodo and follow the **upload instructions**. There will be a step for **requesting a DOI before actually submitting** any files (see also the last question in the "General" section of the [zenodo FAQ](https://help.zenodo.org/){: target=_blank} ). You may want to request such a preliminary DOI before the final submit to your git repository in order to add this DOI to the package description (README.md).
